    "### 🔍 **Why Manual Tool Testing Matters**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before integrating individual tools into an automated agent workflow, it is crucial to validate that each tool works as expected when used in isolation. Manual testing provides several key benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reliability:** Verifies that authentication, inputs, and outputs for each tool are correct, ensuring consistent behavior.\n",
    "- **Debugging:** Makes it easier to identify and fix errors in connectivity, permissions, or logic before they are compounded in an agent-driven pipeline.\n",
    "- **Transparency:** Offers direct feedback on how each tool interacts with external services (like Gmail or Jira), helping you understand their responses and limitations.\n",
    "- **Incremental Development:** Allows you to refine and improve each tool independently, building a strong foundation for robust automation.\n",
    "- **Confidence:** Ensures that when tools are combined in an agent, unexpected failures are minimized and the overall workflow remains robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "Manual testing is a best practice for any complex integration, and it saves time and effort during later stages of automation and scaling.\n",

    "- **Validation:** Helps ensure that integration points work seamlessly together, exposing gaps or edge cases that may not be apparent during isolated tool testing.\n",
    "- **Reusability:** Lays the foundation for future automation by illustrating a template that can be adapted for various business domains.\n",
    "- **Impactful Storytelling:** Turns technical capabilities into a compelling narrative, making it easier to communicate the advantages of agent-based architectures to non-technical decision makers.\n",
