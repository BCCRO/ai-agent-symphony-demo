    "    \"\"\"\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **@tool decorator**\n",
    "   - Registers the function with LangChain\n",
    "   - Creates tool attributes (.name, .description, .func)\n",

    "   - Transforms regular functions into callable tools\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Function name**\n",
    "   - Used by LLM to select appropriate tool\n",
    "   - Used as reference in chains and tool mappings\n",
    "   - Appears in tool call logs for debugging\n",
    "   - Should clearly indicate the tool's purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Type annotations**\n",
    "   - Enable automatic input validation\n",
    "   - Create schema for parameters\n",
    "   - Allow proper serialization of inputs/outputs\n",
    "   - Help LLM understand required input formats\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Docstring**\n",
    "   - Provides context for the LLM to decide when to use the tool\n",
    "   - Documents parameter requirements\n",
    "   - Explains expected outputs and behavior\n",
    "   - Critical for tool selection by the LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Implementation**\n",
    "   - Executes the actual operation\n",
    "   - Handles errors appropriately\n",
    "   - Returns properly formatted results\n",
    "   - Should be efficient and robust\n",

      "In the context of artificial intelligence (AI), an agent is an entity that perceives its environment through sensors and acts upon that environment through actuators or effectors. The agent's actions are determined by a set of rules or a decision-making process, which is often based on the information it gathers from its environment. The goal of an AI agent is typically to achieve specific objectives or maximize some notion of cumulative reward.\n",
      "\n",
      "AI agents can be classified into different types based on their capabilities and complexity:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Simple Reflex Agents**: These agents select actions based solely on the current percept, ignoring the rest of the percept history. They operate on condition-action rules, also known as production rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Model-Based Reflex Agents**: These agents maintain an internal model of the world, which allows them to keep track of parts of the world they cannot see. This model helps them make decisions based on both the current percept and the history of percepts.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Goal-Based Agents**: These agents act to achieve specific goals. They use goal information to guide their actions, which often involves planning and decision-making processes to determine the best course of action to achieve their objectives.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Utility-Based Agents**: These agents aim to maximize their own expected \"utility,\" a measure of satisfaction or happiness. They evaluate different possible actions based on a utility function and choose the action that maximizes expected utility.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Learning Agents**: These agents have the ability to learn from their experiences and improve their performance over time. They can adapt to changes in the environment and improve their decision-making processes based on feedback.\n",
      "\n",
      "AI agents can be implemented in various forms, ranging from simple software programs to complex robotic systems, and they are used in a wide range of applications, including autonomous vehicles, virtual assistants, and game-playing systems.\n"
